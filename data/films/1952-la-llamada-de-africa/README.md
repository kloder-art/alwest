## Sinopsis

A businessman arrives to the Spanish Sahara with the mission of building a
landing field. The political conditions in Europe cause this field becomes a
military objective that the Spanish troops will have to defend no matter what it
costs. Andrade, a Spanish officer in love with the territory and its people,
commanded by an indigenous harka and Lieutenant Ochoa, a military officer, will
confront the enemy whose mission is to destroy the airfield and its landing
field.
