## Bio

Álex de la Iglesia is a Spanish cult director, author of The Day of the Beast
(1995) and Mutant Action (1993), which have their own very strong but small
followings, and Perdita Durango (1997), which will go down in history as
probably the weirdest Javier Bardem film he ever made (it was released in the US
only a few years before Before Night Falls (2000)).

Iglesia belongs to the unofficial new generation of Hispanic filmmakers which
includes Mexicans Alejandro G. Iñárritu and Alfonso Cuarón, and
Mexican-Americans Guillermo del Toro and Robert Rodriguez.
