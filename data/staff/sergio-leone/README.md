# Bio

Sergio Leone was virtually born into the cinema - he was the son of Roberto
Roberti (A.K.A. Vincenzo Leone), one of Italy's cinema pioneers, and actress
Bice Valerian. Leone entered films in his late teens, working as an assistant
director to both Italian directors and U.S. directors working in Italy (usually
making Biblical and Roman epics, much in vogue at the time). Towards the end of
the 1950s he started writing screenplays, and began directing after taking over
Los últimos días de Pompeya (1959) in mid-shoot after its original director fell
ill. His first solo feature, El Coloso de Rodas (1961), was a routine Roman
epic, but his second feature, Por un puñado de dólares (1964), a shameless
remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961), caused a revolution. Although it
wasn't the first spaghetti Western, it was far and away the most successful,
and shot former T.V. cowboy Clint Eastwood to stardom (Leone wanted Henry Fonda
or Charles Bronson but couldn't afford them). The two sequels, La muerte tenía
un precio (1965) and El bueno, el feo y el malo (1966), were shot on much higher
budgets and were even more successful, though his masterpiece, Hasta que llegó
su hora (1968), in which Leone finally worked with Fonda and Bronson, was
mutilated by Paramount Pictures and flopped at the U.S. box office. He directed
¡Agáchate, maldito! (1971) reluctantly, and turned down offers to direct El
padrino (1972) in favor of his dream project, which became Érase una vez en
América (1984). He died in 1989 after preparing an even more expensive Soviet
coproduction on the World War II siege of Leningrad. (IMDB)
