He and several of\nhis colleagues, who once made a living in American Westerns shot in Spain, now\nare reduced to doing stunt shows for minuscule audiences on the decaying set\nbuilt for those old Westerns. Julián wrestles with dark memories of the death of\nhis son, also a stuntman, and with estrangement from his daughter-in-law Laura\nand her son Carlos. Carlos, a young boy, becomes intrigued with his late\nfather's life and runs away to join Julián and his band of has-beens. There\nCarlos is initiated into the rambunctious life of these hard-drinking faux\ncowboys. But when Laura, a powerful executive looking for a new site for a\ntourist resort, learns that Carlos has joined the hated Julián, she moves to\ndestroy even this remnant of Julián's once-proud career. Julián and the cowboys\ndecide to fight back the only way they know how.</p>\n<p>—Jim Beaver <a href=\"mailto:jumblejim@prodigy.net\">jumblejim@prodigy.net</a></p>"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"800-balas"}},
