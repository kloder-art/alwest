Vincenzo Leone), one of Italy's cinema pioneers, and actress\nBice Valerian. Leone entered films in his late teens, working as an assistant\ndirector to both Italian directors and U.S. directors working in Italy (usually\nmaking Biblical and Roman epics, much in vogue at the time). Towards the end of\nthe 1950s he started writing screenplays, and began directing after taking over\nLos últimos días de Pompeya (1959) in mid-shoot after its original director fell\nill. His first solo feature, El Coloso de Rodas (1961), was a routine Roman\nepic, but his second feature, Por un puñado de dólares (1964), a shameless\nremake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961), caused a revolution. Although it\nwasn't the first spaghetti Western, it was far and away the most successful,\nand shot former T.V. cowboy Clint Eastwood to stardom (Leone wanted Henry Fonda\nor Charles Bronson but couldn't afford them). The two sequels, La muerte tenía\nun precio (1965) and El bueno, el feo y el malo (1966), were shot on much higher\nbudgets and were even more successful, though his masterpiece, Hasta que llegó\nsu hora (1968), in which Leone finally worked with Fonda and Bronson, was\nmutilated by Paramount Pictures and flopped at the U.S. box office. He directed\n¡Agáchate, maldito! (1971) reluctantly, and turned down offers to direct El\npadrino (1972) in favor of his dream project, which became Érase una vez en\nAmérica (1984). He died in 1989 after preparing an even more expensive Soviet\ncoproduction on the World War II siege of Leningrad. (IMDB)</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"sergio-leone"}},
